flask-practice
==============

Easy Flask app that I use to practice - delete all code &amp; re-type from memory as quickly as possible.


Learning Flask the hard way - with lots of practice!

How to practice:

1. clone this repository & study (memorize) the code
2. delete ALL the source files & directories (except .git/)
3. recreate all the files by typing from memory
4. diff against git HEAD to see if you missed anything or made mistakes
5. REPEAT until proficient
